#Realm King
Realm King is a tool suite for programmers, modders, and hackers for Realm of the Mad God, or similar games. The objective of this project is to make developer's lives easier, and hopefully inspire new people to get interested in the RotMG development community. Realm of the Mad God is a brilliant game, but it isn't getting the attention it deserves, so we must take the development into our own hands alongside of the RotMG dev team.
